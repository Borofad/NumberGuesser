# Neural Network Digit Recognizer(JavaFX + MNIST)
NumberGuesser combines a simple fully connected neural network with a custom JavaFX based paint interface. Users can draw digits directly on a canvas, and the neural network which was already trained on a MNIST dataset will try to recognize it(repository doesn't include MNIST training/testing files)
